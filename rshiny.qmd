The R Shiny application for **Project Hooked** aims to help users explore the data as provided for mini-challenge 3 of the VAST Challenge 2023 through 3 different lenses:

**Financial Risks:** This module allows user to explore the financial status (e.g., Total Revenue by subgraph, Total Revenue per company, Total Revenue per Beneficial Owner) to identify fishy clusters.

**Country Risks:** The goal of this module aims to help users explore this data from a country perspective. Answering questions such as, "Which subgraph spans across most countries?", "Are there any unique features of these subgraphs?"

**Network Risks:** This module allows user to visualise the over network of each subgraph, to deep dive into the relationships betweens companies, beneficial owners and company contacts.

**Ranking:** To tie all the individual risks together, this module allow users to select variables they believe are important when identifying illegal fishing entities, and would reveal the outlier subgraphs accordingly.
