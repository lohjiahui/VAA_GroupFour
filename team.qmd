Hello! We are Jiahui, Kah Boon and Yixin from MITB at SMU hoping to bring data to live through meaningful visaulisation approaches.

As we embark on the thrilling roller coaster journey that is R Shiny, we cannot overlook the invaluable guidance and support we've received from our esteemed honorary team member and mentor, Associate Professor of Information Systems (Practice), Prof Kam Tin Seong. His expertise has been the guiding beacon that keeps us from getting lost in the vast ocean of data (pun intended).
