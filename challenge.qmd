As part of the VAST Challenge, participants may participate in 3 mini-challenges and one grand challenge. For the purpose of this project, the team will take on mini-challenge 3.

### **Mini-Challenge 3: Detect Anomalies**

FishEye International has been given access to an international finance corporation's database on fishing related companies. In the past, FishEye has determined that companies with anomalous structures are far more likely to be involved in IUU.

This challenge involves helping FishEye develop a new visual analytics approach to better understand fishing business anomalies.

**The specific objectives are:**

|                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|:-----------------:|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ![](image/anomaly.png){width="65"} | Use visual analytics to identify anomalies in the business groups present in the knowledge graph.                                                                                                  |
| ![](image/similar.png){width="65"} | Develop a visual analytics process to find similar businesses and group them, focusing on a business's most important features.                                                                    |
| ![](image/measure.png){width="65"} | Measure similarity of businesses that you group in the previous question. Express confidence in your groupings visually.                                                                           |
| ![](image/illegal.png){width="65"} | Based on the developed visualisation, provide evidence for or against the case that anomalous companies are involved in illegal fishing. Which business groups should FishEye investigate further? |

Lastly, a reflection will be done to document the following:

-   What was the most difficult aspect of working with this knowledge graph?
-   Did the team have the tools and resources you needed to complete the challenge?
-   What additional resources would have helped us?
